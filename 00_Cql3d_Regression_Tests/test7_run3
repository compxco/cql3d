#This script run a series of test cases of the new 
#difus_io_drrscale and difus_io_drscale time-dependent
#radial diffusion scale factors.
#These short tests has nstop=3, rather than usual nstop~135.
#(Part of 8 runs series from /home/bobh/cql3d/mst/171031_anderson/FI_runaway.5.tests.0/210720_rerun)

#Base case creating drrdrout.nc, including radial pinch term.
cp cqlinput_w_transp_short_drrdrout cqlinput
$XCQL3D |tee log_w_transp_short_drrdrout

#Reading in drrdrout.nc, and checking get approximately same results as
#previous run.  It need not be exactly the same, as the pinch term is
#recalculated at each time step (after the first), and the drrdrout.nc
#file contains the pinch term at only the final time step.
cp cqlinput_w_transp_short_drrdrin cqlinput
$XCQL3D |tee log_w_transp_short_drrdrin

#Double the diffusion and pinch using the difus_io_drrscale() and
#difus_io_drscale() factors, and check if results have changed.
cp cqlinput_w_transp_short_drrdrin_2X cqlinput
$XCQL3D |tee log_w_transp_short_drrdrin_2X
# ==> Central energy reduced ~20%, and profile flattened (Fr 51 of .ps file).
